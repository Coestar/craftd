Welcome to craftd!

This is early, pre-alpha software.  If you aren't familiar with autotools, 
please wait until binary packages are available or at least source tarballs.

You need libevent-2 from git for the time being.
git clone git://github.com/nmathewson/Libevent.git

== Users ==
Wait for a release tarball.  The git repo does not track the generated configure
script.

./configure; make; make install
/usr/local/bin/craftd

== Developers ==
Please contact me and let me know what parts you intend to work on first.

Generating ./configure:
autoreconf
automake --add-missing

You should have a good understanding of libevent-2.
