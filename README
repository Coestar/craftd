Welcome to craftd!  Up to date documentation lives at:
http://mc.kev009.com/craftd/

This is early, pre-alpha software.  If you aren't familiar with autotools, 
please wait until binary packages are available or at least source tarballs.

Dependencies:
libevent 2.0.9+ - http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
zlib 1.2.3+ - http://zlib.net/
Jansson (Git head) - http://github.com/akheron/jansson - Will probably bundle this later
Pthreads

Successfully built on:
Linux - GCC, LLVM/clang
FreeBSD - GCC
IRIX - MIPSpro (Big-Endian functionality verified)
AIX - xlC, GCC (Big-Endian functionality verified)
Windows - MinGW - Needs rework.  Priority is getting basics working on UNIX.

== Users ==
Wait for a release tarball.  The git repo does not track the generated configure
script.

./configure; make; make install
/usr/local/bin/craftd

== Developers ==
Please contact me and let me know what parts you intend to work on first.

Generating ./configure:
autoreconf -i
